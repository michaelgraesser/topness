This directory contains a simple c++ program illustrating how to call the topness routine, for use in analysing events 
produced at hadron colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider. 

The topness routine is designed to discriminate against the pair production of top quarks, in which the final state contains a single lepton. 
This algorithm is described further in

Usage

After setting the enviromental variable (topness_alpha) to point to the top level directory topness_alpha, containing the example and source directories, 

simply go to example/ and type 

make test 

to create the executable. To run, type 

./test 

No additional inputs at the command line are needed. Source code has been tested on Linux and MacOSX. 

test computes S, where the topness value of a sample event is ln S. In test.cpp two fake events are provided, as well as the example parameters used in 
the reference above. 

This code comes with two additional directories (source/my_Nelder_Mead and source/topness) containing the custom source code needed to determine topness for an input event.

For more details, please see the above reference and/or the source code provided.  
 
Please cite the above article if using topness. 

The code is written by Michael L. Graesser.
